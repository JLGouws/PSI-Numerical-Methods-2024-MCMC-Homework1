    "So $\\Omega_M = 1$, $\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 0$ would be a flat universe containing all matter, while\n",
    "$\\Omega_M = 0.25$, $\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 0.5$ would be a spatially closed universe with dark energy and matter.\n",
    "Varying these ingredients changes the growth history of the universe, which changes how much the light from a\n",
